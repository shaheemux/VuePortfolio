               "description": "My name is Shaheem Salie . I was born and raised in MItchell's Plain Tafelsig . I am 24 years old and i completed matric in 2018 . I worked a full year as a driver assistant and a driver . The follwoing year , I studied IT Technical Support while working part time as a driver . 3 months after completing my IT course , I applied to work in a call center . The follwing month , I applied for an IT Technician assistant vacancy that was available but unfortunately i did not make the cut for the role . I then offered my services and offered to work for free and my request was approved . 2 weeks was all i had to prove myself , after the first week i recieved an email stating that i should come in for a interview . I was eventually employed and worked until my coontract ended . One my contract ended , I decided to work independently . I used that opportunity to upskill myself in a few aspects in my profession which was being a reliable driver and technical skills . Its the year 2022 and i came across Life Choices Acedamy and immediately got drawn to coding and started making some very important life choices of my own .",
